Comments describing functions are in hw4.pl

Assumptions used:
- From piazza: "1. An error token can be part of a word, which means the example is wrong and should succeed with  M=[m,o,r,s,e,#,as];"
-If there are two error tokens after a space (#), then the first error token will delete the previous word, spaace, and itself. Next
 error token counts as part of the new word now and thus won't delete anything before it. This second error token can be deleted by
 another error token that comes after it.

 Example behaviour resulting from assumptions:
 - [m,o,r,s,e,#,c,o,error,error,error,as] => [m,o,r,s,e,#,as]
 - [m,o,r,s,e,#,c,o,error,error,as] => [m,o,r,s,e,#,error,as]
 - [m,o,r,s,e,#,c,o,error,as] => [m,o,r,s,e,#,as]
 - [m,o,r,s,e,#,error,error,error,as] => [as]
 - [m,o,r,s,e,#,error,error,as] => [error, as]
 - [m,o,r,s,e,#,error,as] => [error, as]
